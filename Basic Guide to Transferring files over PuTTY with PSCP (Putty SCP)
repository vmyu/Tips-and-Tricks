Installation and Setup:
- Install PuTTY
- Install PSCP
- Open command prompt and type: set PATH="%PATH%;%ProgramFiles%\putty" (repace the quoted path with where you placed your pscp.exe file if it is not in C:\ProgramFiles\putty)
- Control Panel > System Properties Advanced > Environmental Variables ... (you can search view advanced system settings alternatively)
- Select Path and click Edit...
- Click New and type in the path of which the pscp.exe file is located in (for example, again I placed mine in the default PuTTY location... so the path would be: C:\Program Files\putty)
- Click ok, ok again, then ok to close out of system properties.
- To test if setup is successful, open command prompt and type pscp
- If setup is successful, you will see the details on PSCP such as version and command line options.


Updating an already existing file on the linux machine (for my example, I am using a raspberry pi):
- Open command prompt
- Type the following command, replacing values appropriately for your machines and fies.
- pscp -P [port number of machine here] [Path and file name of file you wish to transfer over to the machine] [user of machine]@[ip of machine]:[path and file name of destination]
- Example:
- pscp -P 22 Desktop\test.txt pi@[ip-goes-here]:ssh_test/test.txt
- After hitting enter, you will be prompted for the password. Type password and hit enter.
- Upon success, you should receive confirmation of file transfer. 
- Example: test.txt                  | 0 kB |   0.1 kB/s | ETA: 00:00:00 | 100%
